# Headings

## Headings Are Important

Search engines use the headings to index the structure and content of your web pages.

Users often skim a page by its headings. It is important to use headings to show the document structure.

`<h1>` headings should be used for main headings, followed by `<h2>` headings, then the less important `<h3>`, and so on.
